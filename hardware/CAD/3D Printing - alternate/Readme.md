## Alternate Designs for 3D Printing

Alternate versions of the STL parts, and extra parts beyond the standard kit
<br>Note from David: When we send STL files to a print shop, they sometimes print in
<br>the wrong orientation.  If you send an STL with combined parts, it makes it 
<br>more obvious which way they go.

<br>Rod brackets: set of 4 for 1 full robot
<br>Wheel brackets: both sides in one STL
